# Notepad application
A simple notepad application implemented using QT C++.
<br><br>
To run the code, simply copy and paste all the files and folder into a single folder and open it using QT creator. Then, build the application to start it.
<br>
### Features added are as follows:
<ul>
<li>'Save' &amp; 'Save as' options</li>
<li>'Open' option</li>
<li>'New' option</li>
<li>'Undo' &amp; 'Redo' options</li>
<li>'Cut', 'Copy' &amp; 'Paste' options</li>
<li>'Bold', 'Superscript' &amp; 'Subscript' text styles</li>
<li>Added a portion of the resume which can be accessed with the 'About Me' option under the 'Extras' menu item</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

To undo the effects of the 'Superscript' or the 'Subscript' text styles, the 'Normalize' option is added to bring the text back to its original form.
<br><br>
Created a dialog window for showing the resume under the 'Extras' menu item with the 'About Me' option, added appropriate styling and scrollable area. The minimum size of the dialog window is set to 800x600 so by default scroll bar will not be visible, however, on adding expanding the resume details, the scroll bar will eventually come to use.
